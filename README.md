# MirazDefused
My code has compted the 1st and half of 2nd question i did created api's for 3rd . The code is not much up to the expectation since I havent integrated the apis that much. 
Start from h1.htm the includes the 1st ques and I assumed that when the user comes to the website he will be shown all profiles before his log in but thats not the right assumption i do want to make a lot of options on the first page which would have include sig in sign up and about the creater of the website but was not able to do so.
the compatibility.js is the file that makes a json file out of the given csv file which is req for the 2nd problem.
Sorry for this bad site I created.
